# blender-train

This has two train cart models - one that is futuristic (cyberpunk-themed), and one that is modern. I wanted to make this since I had an idea for a game that would incorporate trains. Hour 4 has the final version of the futuristic train, and hour 5 has the modern version. For the modern version, I added a lot of windows & white lighting. I couldn't import some of the STL files since I went over my limit for Github LFS, but the FBX, BLEND, and image files are all in this repo.
